  <summary>What is an SSH key?</summary>

> When working with SSH, you’ll often come across SSH keys.  
> These are cryptographic keys that let you log into a server without typing a password.  
> For this to work, the server must have the **public** part of your key installed and configured to allow your user to log in.  
> Once that's done, you can authenticate using the **private** key, instead of a password.  
>
> If you want to explore the topic more deeply, look up tutorials or documentation online there’s plenty of good material out there.
